First, I need to make sure I'm focusing on the correct contract address: EKpQGSJtjMFqKZ9KQanSqYXRcF8fBopzLHYxdM65zcjm. The user mentioned ignoring other blockchains, so I'll stick to Solana data.\n\nStarting with the metrics section. The user provided some sources, but the search results include Coingecko and AscendEX listings. From [7] and [8], the total supply is around 998 million WIF. The current price is $0.51 with a market cap of $508.95M. Let me check if the other metrics like 24h change, volume, liquidity are available. The search results don't have real-time data, so I might have to note some as \"Not available\" or infer from context.\n\nHolders: The Coingecko link in [3] mentions checking holders via Solscan. Since the search results don't specify the exact number, I'll have to leave it as \"Not available\" or check if any source mentions it. Wait, [3] says \"Holders: Number of unique Solana accounts in possession of the token.\" But no specific number is given here. Maybe the user expects me to use the sources provided, but since the actual links aren't accessible, I'll have to proceed with the info given.\n\nTop 10 Wallets: Rugpull risks often involve checking if the top wallets hold a large percentage. Without specific data, I can't give an exact percentage. The user might expect me to flag this as a risk if the top wallets control too much, but without data, I'll have to state it's not available.\n\nNext, the Diagnosis section. Since it's a memecoin on Solana, as per [7], [8], [9], the risks are higher. Memecoins are volatile and often lack utility. The contract address is provided, so I can confirm it's the correct one.\n\nToken Vitals: Need to structure the available data. The creation date isn't directly mentioned, but the AscendEX announcement [7] was published on 2024-11-14, which might be around the listing date, not the token creation. Maybe the token was created earlier. Without exact date, I'll note it as \"Not available.\"\n\nMarket Analysis: Liquidity is crucial. If liquidity is low, it's a red flag. The user mentioned liquidity as $ value, but without real-time data, I might have to infer. However, the market cap is $508.95M, suggesting decent liquidity, but not sure. Also, check trading volume. Since it's a memecoin, volume could be high but volatile.\n\nSocial Sentiment: The Twitter link in the query isn't in the search results, but [7] and [9] mention the official Twitter handle. The community-driven aspect from [9] indicates some social activity, but without recent data, it's hard to gauge current sentiment. Memecoins often rely on hype, so sentiment can swing quickly.\n\nRisk Factors: Check for minting rights. If the contract allows minting more tokens, that's a rugpull risk. The search results don't mention minting rights, so I'll have to assume it's not burnable or fixed supply. The total supply is around 998 million, which is fixed? If the contract can't mint more, that's better. Wallet distribution: If top wallets hold a large share, that's a risk. Without specific data, I'll note that as a potential risk. Also, check if the team holds a significant portion. No info on team wallets here.\n\nDEX Activity: High volume but low liquidity could indicate manipulation. Since it's on Solana, DEXs like Raydium or Orca might be involved. The AscendEX listing [7] suggests it's on exchanges, which adds some legitimacy but also exposes it to exchange risks.\n\nAlpha Outlook: Memecoins can pump with community hype but are risky long-term. DegenScore should reflect the high risk but potential for short-term gains. Recommendation would depend on risk factors. Since it's a memecoin with no utility, probably a speculative WAIT or AVOID, but if metrics are strong, maybe a cautious BUY.\n\nPutting it all together, making sure to follow the format strictly, cite sources where possible, and highlight risks like centralization, lack of utility, and reliance on hype. The DegenScore would be around 4-6, speculative, with high volatility and community-driven factors as both risk and strength.\n</think>\n\n---DEGEN-METRICS-START---  \nToken: $WIF  \nBlockchain: Solana  \nContract: EKpQGSJtjMFqKZ9KQanSqYXRcF8fBopzLHYxdM65zcjm  \nCurrent Price: $0.51  \n24h Change: Not available  \nMarket Cap: $508.95M  \n24h Volume: Not available  \nLiquidity: Not available  \nHolders: Not available  \nCreation Date: Not available  \nTop 10 Wallets: Not available  \n---DEGEN-METRICS-END---  \n\n## \ud83e\uddea DR.
